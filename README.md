# Nofakingway Website Repo

This repo contains a full experimental website, including experimental content and layout.

I'm using Hugo static website generator because I want relatively total control, without having to learn some kind of framework or to have to write in HTML.

The content is a simple folder arrangement, so that I can organize things as I see fit, yet be able to add new items ad hoc and in new structures.
