description: Are these random-shooter mass-killers driven by right-wing or left-wing ideologies. What can be done about it?

News reports immediately following this event often claimed that the shooting was an obvious consequence of Trump's supposed support for "right-wing extremism" but does this claim have any basis in reality? Why is this conclusion promoted so soon after the shooting?

One of the dominant threads in this manifesto is that corporations and capitalist interests give money to politicians (as if the politicians are helpless when they have a dollar waived in front of their face) and therefor "own" the politicians.

"The government is unwilling to tackle these issues beyond empty promises since they are owned by corporations."

The question is never asked why the corporations need to pay politicians in order to conduct business in their industry.

All resident citizens are assumed to be the rightfull owners of any jobs created by those politician-owning corporations, though. This narrative doesn't leave much room for morality on the part of job-seekers, who seem to just want their cut from the corporations who "own" the politicians. They point at the corruption, not to end it, but because they want to _take part in it_.
