# Right from Wrong

We are at a time of great confusion, and it's not an accident. In order to navigate in times of great controversy it is necessary to have a stable coordinate system.

## The Breakdown

People who act, who move in any way, have to make choices about their movements, so people tend to want to comprehend what they are looking at.

People who act also have competitors, so people who oppose their actions. Many of the competitors make some effort to be honest but, of course, there are many other competitors too, who employ varying degrees of dishonesty.

Some competitors will compete by making it dificult for other actors to comprehend what they are looking at.
