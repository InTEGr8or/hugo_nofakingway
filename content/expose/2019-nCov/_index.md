Xinhau:

    This is Xi from Xinhua News Agency. I have one question: A large number of Chinese people are outraged over the death of Dr. Li Wenliang, partly because he was previously investigating the spreading rumors of virus symptoms. We know that the WHO is is right now reiterating again and again it's determination to fight against the spread of the rumors and misinformation, uh, against the so-called misinformation epidemic, as you call it.

    So, that's also the reason why we are here today. Uh, if it is understandably unimmaginably hard to distinguish between truth and false information we have right now in dealing with the virus, that we knew nothing about a month ago, we also know it is extremely important to have the truth, expecially as we are fighting the disease.

    So my question is, how may the WTO, uh, the WHO ensure it figghts against rumors, without creating bigger rumors, in the complex situation, and what suggestion would the WHO give to other publications, authorities, or the media like us, in our common fight against misinformation.

Dr. Tedros: (Make sure they ask a little bit shorter questions.)
