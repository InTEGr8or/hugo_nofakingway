It's important what we call things, and one of the most important political/ethical distinctions made in the modern world today is between two different names that we call one thing.

## Personal Perspective

All of this has a single implication for each and every individual, and that is the following question:

How would you rather be influenced by society:

1. Social influence is applied when you have to coordinate and integrate your life with other people. You decide if the arrangement would be beneficial, and they decide if it would be beneficial for them. No one can predict the outcome with certainty, but the self-interested, first-hand observers have the most detailed information and have self-evident, self-justified interest.
2. Public vote contest decides how you will be integrated with society, taking into account any variety of political concerns, but certainly not all possible political concerns. It will probably just take into account the most loudly promoted, or politically influential concerns at the time, such as those pertaining to recently identified social ills, or the ones that were most traumatic for the intellectual elites.
