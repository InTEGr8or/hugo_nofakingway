# Morality

Morality is a system of good behavior, virtue, and a method of discovering and understanding good behavior. It units good behavior with valid knowledge.

To unify knowledge with behavior you must have a way of integrating the two.

How do you go from knowing something to be true to knowing how to act? And then how do you go back from having acted and understand the results of your action, and what knowledge you can learn from it?
