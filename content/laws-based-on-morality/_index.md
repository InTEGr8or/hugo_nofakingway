title: Laws Based on Morality
description: Contrary to popular opinion, laws are based on morality. Not the other way around.

"It's bad because it's illegal" is a circular argument and begs the question "why is it illegal?" As a young person you may accept that laws are written for many reasons, and that someone must have made each law for some reason. After living for a few dacades and seeing the laws obeyed, disobeyed and carried out, and you've seen the long-term consequences of violating the law, of of poorly written laws, eventually you must ask, "What are laws based on?"
