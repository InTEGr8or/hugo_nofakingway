## 2018-09-29 Kavanaugh

People want you to focus on the woman, or the man, or the male-vs-female. But that's not what's happening. The Party leaders who want you to focus exclusively on the alleged victim, have done this before, in the 80's during Clarence Thomas hearings. Then in the 90's they wanted you to completely ignore the victim, Lewinsky, and actively shame her to this day.

The Democrat Party leadership do not care about women, or the poor, or minorities, or you. You are a pawn in their play for power. What you are really seeing is not a defense of the oppressed. It is a subversion and undermining of our political process by people who want more control over your life.

So I have not been following the hearings. I have not been concerned about the particular injustices committed or not against Ford or Kavanaugh, because I see a much more dire and widespread hazard which has developed in the political/ethical system in which Ford, Kavanaugh, and we have had the good fortune to live and develop within.

What I see is that everyone has been invited to pass judgement with very little evidence. With so little factual basis on which to formulate a judgement the vast majority fall back to the easy, practiced position of defending their team, their faction, The Party. This is exactly how your political minders reorient you towards a political-view-of-everything, and lead you back onto their plantation.
