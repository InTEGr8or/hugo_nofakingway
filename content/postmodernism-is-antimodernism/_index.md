Inaccurate word usage is highly corrupting, but it is a favorite tool of anti-modernists. Every logical argument makes a case in favor of modernism, so the anti-modernist movement has to move away from logical arguments.

They realize how weak their case would be even to a superficial observer, if they had to use logic to refute logic, so instead they resort to the goal of corrupting logic itself.

One of the attacks on logic is the theory of "historical materialism".
