## Halt and Catch Fire

There is a scene at the begining of _Halt and Catch Fire_ where the instructor asks what the greatest innovations of the next twenty years will be. A student raises his hand and says, as if it's a trick question, that AI will develop farther and take over human tasks. The hero girl student says ubiquitous communications will be used to connect people to each other in deeper and richer ways.

Of course the girl is right. Peter Thiel was asked in a recent interview with Dave Ruben about why he invested in the early Facebook startup. He explained that people were trying to create online communities at the time, but they thought it would go into "virtual reality" escapism where people could play roles that they were only fantasizing about before. But Facebook was connecting real people with real names with their faces and getting users contacts from their email and phone contact lists, and through real freind-of-friend relationships.
