We are helping stamp out the scourge of "fake news", and the best place to start is at it's root: misused words, phrases, and concepts.

Modern news promoters and political organizations are actively undermining their fidelity to the truth. They are undermining the very concept of truth, even asking "Do we live in a post-truth world?"

Their motto should be _"By any news necessary."_

The Left and Right sides of the political spectrum have different definitions for the meanings of some very important terms.
