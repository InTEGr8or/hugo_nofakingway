# Honesty Saves

Turning down the noise in the cultural chatter.

That seems to be a high priority right now, with all the cries of "fake news" and "foreign influence" in political campaigns. But how did we get here? Haven't we always known that false information is not helpful, or even dangerous?

Well, no. No, not at all. No, we _absolutely_ do not understand the high cost of lies. That is not the society that you live in. The society you live in has a cultural vocabulary and widespread practice of dealing in lies. This is not just a problem among the elites. There is broad acceptance of trading lies, especially in the realm of politics. Where honesty is favored in the practical and technical realms of activity, the political realm has become the upside-down-world of ethical interaction. Deception tactics are not only used against war-making beligerents, but are accepted tools to be used within a state against the very public that elects the rulers. Moreover, the policy of lies is even defended, and holds currency, among the electorate.

## The Noble Lie

> To walk in the NofaKingway you can come from anywhere, and bring anything _that works_. All you have to discard is _what doesn't work_.

We are helping stamp out the scourge of "fake news", and the best place to start is at it's root: misused words, phrases, and concepts.

Modern news promoters and political organizations are actively undermining their fidelity to the truth. They are undermining the very concept of truth, even asking "Do we live in a post-truth world?"

Their motto should be _"By any news necessary."_

The Left and Right sides of the political spectrum have different definitions for the meanings of some very important terms.
