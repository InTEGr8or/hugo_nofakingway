      <description>So far, this Hugo on my PC is looking better than Hugo on the Mac was. I am liking. This also seems to be much more actively developed than the DocPad product. I think I am looking forward to learning Go.</description>

      <title>Building in DocPad</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve started developing in Docpad because I love lo-fi text-only documentation. This CMS uses folder structure and tags for site hierarchy and is very flexible. The MarkDown is transpiled into html and I can use a veriety of templating languages for the layout components.
I&amp;rsquo;m going under the assumption that this will all provide maximal flexability while I am actively creating content.
Lo-fi Conceptual Representations I write a lot of notes every single day in MarkDown and yaml.</description>
