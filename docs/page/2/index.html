<h3 id="turning-down-the-noise-in-the-cultural-chatter">Turning down the noise in the cultural chatter.</h3>
<p>Reducing distraction and confusion is a high priority right now. With all the cries of &ldquo;fake news&rdquo; and &ldquo;foreign influence&rdquo; in political campaigns, &ldquo;Russian bots&rdquo; and AI algorithms pushing &ldquo;deep fakes&rdquo; on social media.</p>
<p>But how did we get here? Haven&rsquo;t we always known that false information is not helpful, or even dangerous?</p>
<p>Well, no. No, not at all. No, we <em>absolutely</em> do not understand the high cost of lies. That is not the society that you live in. The society you live in has a cultural vocabulary and widespread practice of dealing in lies. This is not just a problem among the elites. There is broad acceptance of trading lies, especially in the realm of politics. Where honesty is favored in the practical and technical realms of activity, the political realm has become the upside-down-world of ethical interaction. Deception tactics are not only used against war-making beligerents, but are accepted tools to be used within a state against the very public that elects the rulers. Moreover, the policy of lies is even defended, and holds currency, among the electorate.</p>
<h2 id="the-noble-lie">The Noble Lie</h2>
<p>A revealing episode occurred on &ldquo;The View&rdquo; with guest Pamela Anderson and hosts Joy Behar and Meghan McCain. <a href="https://twitter.com/ValueCritic/status/1170089759919636483">Mark Stouffer - Value Critic on Twitter</a></p>
<p>ANDERSON:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To walk in the NofaKingway you can come from anywhere, and bring anything <em>that works</em>. All you have to discard is <em>what doesn&rsquo;t work</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We are helping stamp out the scourge of &ldquo;fake news&rdquo;, and the best place to start is at it&rsquo;s root: misused words, phrases, and concepts.</p>
<p>Modern news promoters and political organizations are actively undermining their fidelity to the truth. They are undermining the very concept of truth, even asking &ldquo;Do we live in a post-truth world?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Their motto should be <em>&ldquo;By any news necessary.&quot;</em></p>
<p>The Left and Right sides of the political spectrum have different definitions for the meanings of some very important terms.</p>

After living for a few dacades and seeing the laws obeyed, disobeyed and carried out, and you&rsquo;ve seen the long-term consequences of violating the law, of of poorly written laws, eventually you must ask, &ldquo;What are laws based on?</div>

						Postmodern is the historical materialist way of saying &#34;better than modernism&#34;. Since we aren&#39;t historical materialists, we shouldn&#39;t play their word-game.
					</p>
					<div class="article-summary">Inaccurate word usage is highly corrupting, but it is a favorite tool of anti-modernists. Every logical argument makes a case in favor of modernism, so the anti-modernist movement has to move away from logical arguments.
They realize how weak their case would be even to a superficial observer, if they had to use logic to refute logic, so instead they resort to the goal of corrupting logic itself.
One of the attacks on logic is the theory of &ldquo;historical materialism&rdquo;, which holds that progress occurs as a natural progression caused by the gradual accumilation of technoligical capital goods, or &ldquo;factors of production&rdquo;.</div>
