<p>They realize how weak their case would be even to a superficial observer, if they had to use logic to refute logic, so instead they resort to the goal of corrupting logic itself.</p>

<p>One of the attacks on logic is the theory of &ldquo;historical materialism&rdquo;.</p>

      <div class="article-content"> Media outlets and prominant intellectuals are rightfuly alarmed by the rising predominance of false and misleading news stories and social media posts. They are right to be alarmed, but they are wrong to suggest they were not complicite in the trend.
If cultural intellectuals, the type of who make value statements about culture, can be described by one sweeping term, that term would be &ldquo;relativism&rdquo;.
For quite some time the cultural climate has been one of cultural relativism, that supposedly all cultures are equal, and that has leaked into ideological relativism, the idea that supposedly all ideologies are equal, and that being certain of anything is the only true sign of ignorance.

      <div class="article-content"> I love the flexibility of static generated sites. I can create content easily while I also develop the logical structure of the components and their taxonomical relations.
Most of that is provided by Markdown, including the YAML front-matter. So the static generator just needs to be easy to start and extend, and it also needs to be sustainable.
It doesn&rsquo;t make sense to invest in learning how to use a static site generator that is not being actively used by a community of people.

What is the value of truth? &ldquo;Do you want the truth?&rdquo; This question is often used as a caricature of poorly written dialogue in movies and TV. Of course people want the truth, the criticism goes. At some point, at some level, every person realizes that they want the truth.

This CMS uses folder structure and tags for site hierarchy and is very flexible. The MarkDown is transpiled into html and I can use a variety of templating languages for the layout components.
I&rsquo;m going under the assumption that this will all provide maximal flexibility while I am actively creating content.
Lo-fi Conceptual Representations I write a lot of notes every single day in MarkDown and yaml.
