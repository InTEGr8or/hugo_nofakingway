<p>Turning down the noise in the cultural chatter.</p>

<p>That seems to be a high priority right now, with all the cries of &ldquo;fake news&rdquo; and &ldquo;foreign influence&rdquo; in political campaigns. But how did we get here? Haven&rsquo;t we always known that false information is not helpful, or even dangerous?</p>

<p>Well, no. No, not at all. No, we <em>absolutely</em> do not understand the high cost of lies. That is not the society that you live in. The society you live in has a cultural vocabulary and widespread practice of dealing in lies. This is not just a problem among the elites. There is broad acceptance of trading lies, especially in the realm of politics. Where honesty is favored in the practical and technical realms of activity, the political realm has become the upside-down-world of ethical interaction. Deception tactics are not only used against war-making beligerents, but are accepted tools to be used within a state against the very public that elects the rulers. Moreover, the policy of lies is even defended, and holds currency, among the electorate.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>To walk in the NofaKingway you can come from anywhere, and bring anything <em>that works</em>. All you have to discard is <em>what doesn&rsquo;t work</em>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We are helping stamp out the scourge of &ldquo;fake news&rdquo;, and the best place to start is at it&rsquo;s root: misused words, phrases, and concepts.</p>

<p>Modern news promoters and political organizations are actively undermining their fidelity to the truth. They are undermining the very concept of truth, even asking &ldquo;Do we live in a post-truth world?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Their motto should be <em>&ldquo;By any news necessary.&rdquo;</em></p>

<p>The Left and Right sides of the political spectrum have different definitions for the meanings of some very important terms.</p>

They realize how weak their case would be even to a superficial observer, if they had to use logic to refute logic, so instead they resort to the goal of corrupting logic itself.
One of the attacks on logic is the theory of &ldquo;historical materialism&rdquo;, which holds that progress occurs as a natural progression caused by the gradual accumilation of technoligical capital goods, or &ldquo;factors of production&rdquo;.</div>

Some people will think this statement is hypocritical because of the nearly complete ethnic and cultural destruction brought to the Native Americans by our European ancestors, but this just reinforces my point.

              Media outlets and prominant intellectuals are rightfuly alarmed by the rising predominance of false and misleading news stories and social media posts. They are right to be alarmed, but they are wrong to suggest they were not complicite in the trend.
If cultural intellectuals, the people who make value statements about culture, can be described by one sweeping term, that term would be &ldquo;relativism&rdquo;.
For quite some time the cultural climate has been one of cultural relativism, the idea that all cultures are equal, and that has leaked into ideological relativism, the idea that all ideologies are equal, and that being certain of anything is the only true sign of ignorance.

              I love the flexibility of static generated sites. I can create content easily while I also develop the logical structure of the components and their taxonomical relations.
Most of that is provided by Markdown, including the YAML front-matter. So the static generator just needs to be easy to start and extend, and it also needs to be sustainable.
It doesn&rsquo;t make sense to invest in learning how to use a static site generator that is not being actively used by a community of people.

              Is fidelity to truth something you owe other people? Or, rather, is it something of the very highest importance to yourself?
What is the value of truth? &ldquo;Do you want the truth?&rdquo; This question is often used as a caricature of poorly written dialogue in movies and TV. Of course people want the truth, the criticism goes. At some point, at some level, every person realizes that they want the truth.

              I&rsquo;ve started developing in Docpad because I love lo-fi text-only documentation. This CMS uses folder structure and tags for site hierarchy and is very flexible. The MarkDown is transpiled into html and I can use a variety of templating languages for the layout components.
I&rsquo;m going under the assumption that this will all provide maximal flexibility while I am actively creating content.
Lo-fi Conceptual Representations I write a lot of notes every single day in MarkDown and yaml.

              Misinformed Democratization example citation [@krycho:revelation:2015, ¶6]
Examples of the misatribution of liberalization to democratization  Democracy can be defined as: &gt; A system of government by the whole population or all the eligible members of a state, typically through elected representatives.
 After this definition, the meaning is distorted
 To put it more simply, democratic governments answer to their citizens. Through voting, people frame the institutions that govern them.
