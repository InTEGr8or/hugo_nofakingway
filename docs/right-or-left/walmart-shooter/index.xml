The Inconvenient Truth About Me In general, I support the Christchurch shooter and his manifesto. This attack is a response to the Hispanic invasion of Texas. They are the instigator s, not me. I am simply defending my country from cultural and ethnic replacement brought on by an in vasion. Some people will think this statement is hypocritical because of the nearly complete ethnic and cultural destruction brought to the Native Americans by our European ancestors, but this just reinforces my point.</description>
