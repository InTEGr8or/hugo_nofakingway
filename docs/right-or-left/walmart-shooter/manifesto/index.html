<h2 id="the-inconvenient-truth">The Inconvenient Truth</h2>

<h3 id="about-me">About Me</h3>

<p>In general, I support the Christchurch shooter and
his manifesto. This attack is a response to the
Hispanic invasion of Texas. They are the instigator
s, not me. I am simply defending my country from
cultural and ethnic replacement brought on by an in
vasion. Some people will think this statement is
hypocritical because of the nearly complete ethnic
and cultural destruction brought to the Native
Americans by our European ancestors, but this just
reinforces my point. The natives didn’t take the
invasion of Europeans seriously, and now what’s lef
t is just a shadow of what was. My motives for this
attack are not at all personal. Actually the Hispan
ic community was not my target before I read The
Great Replacement. This manifesto will cover the po
litical and economic reasons behind the attack, my
gear, my expectations of what response this will generate and my personal motivations and thoughts.</p>

<h3 id="political-reasons">Political Reasons</h3>

<p>In short, America is rotting from the inside out, and peaceful means to stop this seem to be nearly impossible. The inconvenient truth is that our leaders, both Democrat AND Republican, have been failing us for decades. They are either complacent or involved in one of the biggest betrayals of the American public in our history. The takeover of the United States government by unchecked corporations. I could write a ten page essay on all the damage these corporations have caused, but here is what is important. Due to the death of the baby boomers, the increasingly anti-immigrant rhetoric of the right and the ever increasing Hispanic population, America will soon become a one party-state. The Democrat party will own America and they know it. They have already begun the transition by pandering heavily to the Hispanic voting bloc in the 1st Democratic Debate. They intend to use open borders, free healthcare for illegals, citizenship and more to enact a political coup by importing and then legalizing millions of new voters. With policies like these, the Hispanic support for Democrats will likely become nearly unanimous in the future. The heavy Hispanic population in Texas will make us a Democrat stronghold. Losing Texas and a few other states with heavy Hispanic population to the Democrats is all it would take for them to win nearly every presidential election. Although the Republican Party is also terrible. Many factions within the Republican Party are pro-corporation. Pro-corporation = pro-immigration. But some factions within the Republican Party don’t prioritize corporations over our future. So the Democrats are nearly unanimous with their support of immigration
while the Republicans are divided over it. At least
with Republicans, the process of mass immigration
and citizenship can be greatly reduced.</p>

<h3 id="economic-reasons">Economic Reasons</h3>

<p>In short, immigration can only be detrimental to the future of America. Continued immigration will make one of the biggest issues of our time, automation, so much worse. Some sources say that in under two decades, half of American jobs will be lost to it. Of course some people will be retrained, but most
will not. So it makes no sense to keep on letting
millions of illegal or legal immigrants flood into the
United States, and to keep the tens of millions that are already here. Invaders who also have close to
the highest birthrate of all ethnicities in America. In
the near future, America will have to initiate a basic
universal income to prevent widespread poverty and
civil unrest as people lose their jobs. Joblessness in
itself is a source of civil unrest. The less depend
ents on a government welfare system, the better. The
lower the unemployment rate, the better. Achieving
ambitions social projects like universal healthcare
and UBI would become far more likely to succeed if
tens of millions of dependents are removed.
Even though new migrants do the dirty work, their kids typically don’t. They want to live the American
Dream which is why they get college degrees and fill higher-paying skilled positions. This is why
corporations lobby for even more illegal immigration even after decades of it of happening. They need
to keep replenishing the low-skilled labor pool. Even as migrant children flood skilled jobs, Corporat
ions make this worse by lobbying for even more work visa
s to be issued for skilled foreign workers to come
here. Recently, the senate under a REPUBLICAN administration has greatly increased the number of
foreign workers that will take American jobs. Remember that both Democrats and Republicans support
immigration and work visas. Corporations need to keep replenishing the labor pool for both skilled and
unskilled jobs to keep wages down. So Automation is
a good thing as it will eliminate the need for new
migrants to fill unskilled jobs. Jobs that American
s can’t survive on anyway. Automation can and would
replace millions of low-skilled jobs if immigrants
were deported. This source of competition for skilled
labor from immigrants and visa holders around the world has made a very difficult situation even worse
for natives as they compete in the skilled job mark
et. To compete, people have to get better credentials
by spending more time in college. It used to be tha
t a high school degree was worth something. Now a
bachelor’s degree is what’s recommended to be competitive in the job market. The cost of college
degrees has exploded as their value has plummeted.
This has led to a generation of indebted,
overqualified students filling menial, low paying and unfulfilling jobs. Of course these migrants and
their children have contributed to the problem, but are n
ot the sole cause of it.
The American lifestyle affords our citizens an incredible quality of life. However, our lifestyle is
destroying the environment of our country. The decimation of the environment is creating a massive
burden for future generations. Corporations are heaing the destruction of our environment by
shamelessly over harvesting resources. This has been
a problem for decades. For example, this
phenomenon is brilliantly portrayed in the decades
old classic “The Lorax”. Water sheds around the
country, especially in agricultural areas, are being depleted. Fresh water is being polluted from farming
and oil drilling operations. Consumer culture is creating thousands of tons of unnecessary plastic waste
and electronic waste, and recycling to help slow this down is almost non-existent. Urban sprawl create
s inefficient cities which unnecessarily destroys millions of acres of land. We even use god knows how
many trees worth of paper towels just wipe water of
f our hands. Everything I have seen and heard in my
short life has led me to believe that the average A
merican isn’t willing to change their lifestyle, even if
the changes only cause a slight inconvenience. The
government is unwilling to tackle these issues
beyond empty promises since they are owned by corporations. Corporations that also like immigration
because more people means a bigger market for their
products. I just want to say that I love the people
of this country, but god damn most of y’all are just too stubborn to change your lifestyle. So the next
logical step is to decrease the number of people in
America using resources. If we can get rid of enough
people, then our way of life can become more sustainable.
Gear
Main gun: AK47 (WASR 10) – I realized pretty quickly that this isn’t a great choice since it’s the civilian
version of the ak47. It’s not designed to shoot rounds quickly, so it overheats massively after about
100 shots fired in quick succession. I’ll have to use a
heat-resistant glove to get around this.
8m3 bullet: This bullet, unlike pretty much any other 7.62x39 bullet, actually fragments like a pistol
hollow point when shot out of an ak47 at the cost o
f penetration. Penetration is still reasonable, but not
nearly as high as a normal ak47 bullet. The ak47 is
definitely a bad choice without this bullet design, and
may still be with it.
Other gun(if I get one): Ar15 – Pretty much any variation of this gun doesn’t heat up nearly as fast a
s the
AK47. The round of this gun isn’t designed to frag
ment, but instead tumbles inside a target causing
lethal wounding. This gun is probably better, but I
wanted to explore different options. The ar15 is
probably the best gun for military applications but
this isn’t a military application.
This will be a test of which is more lethal, either
it’s fragmentation or tumbling.
I didn’t spend much time at all preparing for this
attack. Maybe a month, probably less. I have do this
before I lose my nerve. I figured that an under-prepared attack and a meh manifesto is better than no
attack and no manifesto</p>

<dt>which will hasten the destruction of our country. The environment is getting worse by the year. If you take nothing else from this document, remember this</dt>
<dd>INACTION IS A CHOICE. I can no longer bear the
shame of inaction knowing that our founding fathers
have endowed me with the rights needed to save
our country from the brink destruction. Our European comrades don’t have the gun rights needed to
repel the millions of invaders that plaque their country. They have no choice but to sit by and watch
their countries burn.
America can only be destroyed from the inside-out.
If our country falls, it will be the fault of trait
ors. This
is why I see my actions as faultless. Because this
isn’t an act of imperialism but an act of preservation.
America is full of hypocrites who will blast my act
ions as the sole result of racism and hatred of other
countries, despite the extensive evidence of all the problems these invaders cause and will cause.
People who are hypocrites because they support imperialistic wars that have caused the loss of tens of
thousands of American lives and untold numbers of civilian lives. The argument that mass murder is
okay when it is state sanctioned is absurd. Our government has killed a whole lot more people for a
whole lot less. Even if other non-immigrant targets would have a greater impact, I can’t bring myself to kill my fellow
Americans. Even the Americans that seem hell-bent on destroying our country. Even if they are
shameless race mixers, massive polluters, haters of
our collective values, etc. One day they will see error
of their ways. Either when American patriots fail to reform our country and it collapses or when we save
it. But they will see the error of their ways. I promise y’all that.
I am against race mixing because it destroys genetic diversity and creates identity problems. Also
because it’s completely unnecessary and selfish. 2nd and 3rd
generation Hispanics form interracial unions
at much higher rates than average. Yet another reason to send them back. Cultural and racial diversity
is largely temporary. Cultural diversity diminishes as
stronger and/or more appealing cultures overtake
weaker and/or undesirable ones. Racial diversity will disappear as either race mixing or genocide will
take place. But the idea of deporting or murdering
all non-white Americans is horrific. Many have been
here at least as long as the whites, and have done
as much to build our country. The best solution to
this for now would be to divide America into a confederacy of territories with at least 1 territory for each
race. This physical separation would nearly eliminate race mixing and improve social unity by granting
each race self-determination within their respective territory(s).
My death is likely inevitable. If I’m not killed by
the police, then I’ll probably be gunned down by one of
the invaders. Capture in this case if far worse than dying during the shooting because I’ll get the death
penalty anyway. Worse still is that I would live knowing that my family despises me. This is why I’m not
going to surrender even if I run out of ammo. If I’
m captured, it will be because I was subdued somehow.
Remember: it is not cowardly to pick low hanging fruit. AKA Don’t attack heavily guarded areas to fulfll
your super soldier COD fantasy. Attack low security
targets. Even though you might out gun a security
guard or police man, they likely beat you in armor,
training and numbers. Do not throw away your life
on an unnecessarily dangerous target. If a target seems too hot, live to fight another day.
My ideology has not changed for several years. My opinions on automation, immigration, and the rest
predate Trump and his campaign for president. I put
ting this here because some people will blame the
President or certain presidential candidates for the attack. This is not the case. I know that the media
will probably call me a white supremacist anyway and blame Trump’s rhetoric. The media is infamous
for fake news. Their reaction to this attack will likely just confirm that.
Many people think that the fight for America is already lost. They couldn’t be more wrong. This is just
the beginning of the fight for America and Europe.
I am honored to head the fight to reclaim my country
from destruction.</dd>
