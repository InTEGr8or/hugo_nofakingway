      <p>These are some of the thinking-errors that we intend to correct over the coming months as we develop this site:</p>

<ul>
<li>postmodernism is anti modernism</li>
<li>democratization is actually liberalization</li>
<li>you own your body, your mind, and your life.</li>
<li>no one has ever taken a life.

<ul>
<li>Find someone who claims to or is reported to have taken a life. Ask them to show you the other life, not their own life, but the life that they took. They will not be able to produce it because they don&rsquo;t have the life. &ldquo;Taking a life&rdquo; is a beautification and a euphemism for what the person has actually done, which is destroy a life. That&rsquo;s all they&rsquo;ve done. They have simply destroyed a human life. It&rsquo;s a much more offensive and disgusting thing that they have done than &ldquo;taking a life&rdquo; makes it sound like, which is already bad enough. When a theif steals money he at least has the money he stole. A life destroyer can make no such claim.</li>
<li>serial killers do not achieve control over their victims.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>you will never have free time.</li>
<li>All intelligence is artificial intelligence.

<ul>
<li>People make thinking errors. They think &ldquo;poop smell - air freshener = less poop smell&rdquo;, when really it&rsquo;s &ldquo;poop smell + air freshener = poop smell +air freshener&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s like a poop bouquet. A poopourri. Thinking is a process which must be managed and error checked. #thinkingerrors</li>
<li>Thinking is a process which must be managed and error checked. It is a technology. There is nothing natural about it. It is man-made. That&rsquo;s why we go through the process of education. All intelligence is artificial intelligence. #thinkingerrors</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The concept of perfection is flawed

<ul>
<li>Perfection is infinity-good</li>
<li>Good is building up from a basis towards perfection</li>
<li>A single task can be carried out with perfection, but not forever.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>&ldquo;Antifa&rdquo; are not anti-fascist, but pro-socialist.

<ul>
<li>They boast that they are hard on Hitler-types, with &ldquo;punch a Nazi in the face&rdquo;, but they are soft on Stalin-types, and socialist history itself.</li>
</ul></li>
