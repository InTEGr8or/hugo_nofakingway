      <description>These are some of the thinking-errors that we intend to correct over the coming months as we develop this site:
 postmodernism is anti modernism democratization is actually liberalization you own your body, your mind, and your life. no one has ever taken a life.  Find someone who claims to or is reported to have taken a life. Ask them to show you the other life, not their own life, but the life that they took.</description>

      <description>Media outlets and prominant intellectuals are rightfuly alarmed by the rising predominance of false and misleading news stories and social media posts. They are right to be alarmed, but they are wrong to suggest they were not complicite in the trend.
If cultural intellectuals, the type of who make value statements about culture, can be described by one sweeping term, that term would be &amp;ldquo;relativism&amp;rdquo;.
For quite some time the cultural climate has been one of cultural relativism, that supposedly all cultures are equal, and that has leaked into ideological relativism, the idea that supposedly all ideologies are equal, and that being certain of anything is the only true sign of ignorance.</description>
