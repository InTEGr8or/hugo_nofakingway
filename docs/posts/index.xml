      <description>I love the flexibility of static generated sites. I can create content easily while I also develop the logical structure of the components and their taxonomical relations.
Most of that is provided by Markdown, including the YAML frontmatter. So the static generator just needs to be easy to start and extend, and it also needs to be sustainable.
It doesn&amp;rsquo;t make sense to invest in learning how to use a static site generator that is not being actively used by a comunity of people.</description>

      <description>So far, this Hugo on my PC is looking better than Hugo on the Mac was. I am liking. This also seems to be much more actively developed than the DocPad product. I think I am looking forward to learning Go.</description>

      <title>Developing in Docpad</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve started developing in Docpad because I love lo-fi text-only documentation. This CMS uses folder structure and tags for site hierarchy and is very flexible. The MarkDown is transpiled into html and I can use a veriety of templating languages for the layout components.
I&amp;rsquo;m going under the assumption that this will all provide maximal flexability while I am actively creating content.
Lo-fi Conceptual Representations I write a lot of notes every single day in MarkDown and yaml.</description>
