      <description>I love the flexibility of static generated sites. I can create content easily while I also develop the logical structure of the components and their taxonomical relations.
Most of that is provided by Markdown, including the YAML frontmatter. So the static generator just needs to be easy to start and extend, and it also needs to be sustainable.
It doesn&amp;rsquo;t make sense to invest in learning how to use a static site generator that is not being actively used by a comunity of people.</description>

      <description>Is fidelity to truth something you owe other people? Or, rather, is it something of the very highest importance to yourself?
What is the value of truth? &amp;ldquo;Do you want the truth?&amp;rdquo; This question is often used as a characature of poorly written dialogue in movies and TV. Of course people want the truth, the criticism goes. At some point, at some level, every person realizes that they want the truth.</description>

      <title>Developing in Docpad</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve started developing in Docpad because I love lo-fi text-only documentation. This CMS uses folder structure and tags for site hierarchy and is very flexible. The MarkDown is transpiled into html and I can use a veriety of templating languages for the layout components.
I&amp;rsquo;m going under the assumption that this will all provide maximal flexability while I am actively creating content.
Lo-fi Conceptual Representations I write a lot of notes every single day in MarkDown and yaml.</description>
