      <description>I love the flexibility of static generated sites. I can create content easily while I also develop the logical structure of the components and their taxonomical relations.
Most of that is provided by Markdown, including the YAML front-matter. So the static generator just needs to be easy to start and extend, and it also needs to be sustainable.
It doesn&amp;rsquo;t make sense to invest in learning how to use a static site generator that is not being actively used by a community of people.</description>

      <title>Developing in Docpad</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve started developing in Docpad because I love lo-fi text-only documentation. This CMS uses folder structure and tags for site hierarchy and is very flexible. The MarkDown is transpiled into html and I can use a variety of templating languages for the layout components.
I&amp;rsquo;m going under the assumption that this will all provide maximal flexibility while I am actively creating content.
Lo-fi Conceptual Representations I write a lot of notes every single day in MarkDown and yaml.</description>
