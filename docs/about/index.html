<p>Is fidelity to truth something you owe other people? Or, rather, is it something of the very highest importance to yourself?</p>

<h2 id="what-is-the-value-of-truth">What is the value of truth?</h2>

<p>&ldquo;Do you want the truth?&rdquo; This question is often used as a caricature of poorly written dialogue in movies and TV. Of course people want the truth, the criticism goes. At some point, at some level, every person realizes that they want the truth. Even someone who disagrees with my last statement would claim that their disagreement is based on the truth.</p>

<p>Why, then, do people sometimes argue against the truth?</p>
